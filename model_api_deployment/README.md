# Project 01: Model API Deployment

## Project Overview

Welcome to your first AI Infrastructure project! In this project, you'll build and deploy a REST API that serves predictions from a pre-trained machine learning model. This is a foundational skill that every AI Infrastructure Engineer must master.

### What You'll Build

You'll create a production-ready API that:
- Loads a pre-trained image classification model (ResNet-50 or MobileNetV2)
- Accepts image uploads via HTTP requests
- Returns predictions with confidence scores
- Runs in a Docker container
- Deploys to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Includes monitoring and logging

### Real-World Context

Data scientists train models locally on their laptops or in notebooks. Your job as an infrastructure engineer is to take those model files and make them available to users through a scalable, reliable API. This project simulates that exact scenario - you're the bridge between ML research and production deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.11 or higher** installed

3. **Git** for version control
4. **A cloud account** (AWS Free Tier, GCP Free Trial, or Azure Free Account)
5. **Basic Python knowledge** (functions, classes, imports)
6. **Command line familiarity** (navigating directories, running commands)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Read All Documentation First**
   ```bash
   # Start with these files in order:
   # 1. README.md (this file) - Overview and setup
   # 2. requirements.md - Detailed requirements
   # 3. architecture.md - System design and architecture
   # 4. src/README.md - Code implementation guide
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create project directory
   mkdir model-api-deployment
   cd model-api-deployment

   # Create Python virtual environment
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install dependencies (you'll create this file)
   pip install flask torch torchvision pillow python-dotenv pytest
   ```

   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   curl http://localhost:5000/info
   curl -X POST -F "file=@test_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict

   # Run tests
   pytest tests/
   ```

6. **Containerize**

## Assessment Criteria

Your project will be evaluated on:

- **Code Quality (25%)** - Organization, style, documentation, error handling, testing
- **Functionality (30%)** - API endpoints, model inference, validation, error responses, performance
- **Containerization (15%)** - Dockerfile quality, image size, build process
- **Deployment (20%)** - Cloud setup, accessibility, monitoring, security
- **Documentation (10%)** - README, API docs, deployment guide, architecture

**Passing Score:** 70/100 points

See `requirements.md` for the detailed rubric.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Hardcoding values** - Use environment variables for configuration
2. **No error handling** - Every endpoint should handle errors gracefully
3. **Large Docker images** - Optimize with multi-stage builds and slim base images
4. **Insecure deployment** - Always configure security groups/firewalls properly
5. **No logging** - Logging is essential for debugging production issues
6. **Memory leaks** - Clean up resources after each request
7. **Testing only happy paths** - Test error cases and edge cases thoroughly

---

## Time Management Tips

- **Don't rush Phase 1** - A solid local implementation saves debugging time later
- **Budget extra time for Docker** - Container debugging can be slow
- **Expect deployment failures** - Plan for 2-3 iterations to get cloud deployment right
- **Document as you go** - Don't leave documentation until the end
- **Keep a buffer** - Reserve 10-15 hours for unexpected issues
